# homework-three423

https://in-info-web4.informatics.iupui.edu/~thotran/homework-three423/ For this homework, I created the database or catalog that shows students along with age, class, email address, and phone number. To develop the website, I used:

HTML, CSS, and SASS, as usual JS to add data and to parse data using JSON.stringify Found the way to add information to the local storage I also installed the package.json, just in case

I also added the unused files such as data and model. Please omit those two.
